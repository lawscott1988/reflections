WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO CREATE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER
THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCALLY?

I'm not really sure actually???

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because multiple people could be working on the same files in their local. 
Those changes might not be ready to implement and would cause errors (clashes)
etc if it stayed up to date automatically
